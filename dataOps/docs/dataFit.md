# dataFit

Data fitting routines written to work with data in the format I tend to use
in my coding practice.

*BADGES* - can add badges of metadata such as version info  ([shields.io](https://shields.io/) gives many good options).

### Components

**surface1st/2nd/3rdOrder** -
Surfce fitting routines to produce equations for either a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
order surface equation.

**fitLine** -
A simple line fitting routine

**fitGaussian** -
Fitting a Gaussian function to a 1D data set

**dosePosition** -
Code from Callum, can be used to find the depth in medium or a %-dose
