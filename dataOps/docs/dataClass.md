# dataClass

Custom built data classes I use in my programmes

*BADGES* - can add badges of metadata such as version info  ([shields.io](https://shields.io/) gives many good options).

## Components

**pbtDICOM** -
a subset of the full pyDicom data class to make it easier to handle the
important parts of the data

**TWODdata** -
a simple 2D data set class that allows calling as either columns or rows

**W2CADdata** -
a specific class for the w2cad data format used as input to Varian TPS.
Each row contains an X, Y, Z, and dose/value component.
Also has a header for the whole file, and params for each entry in the file.
