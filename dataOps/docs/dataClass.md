# dataClass

A number of custom created data classes and libraries that I use to make data handling a little easier.

###  TWODdata

A catch all 2-D data format.  
Used by a number of my packages.  


###  W2CADdata

W2CAD is a specific data format used by Varian for TPS input files.  
Has a very specific structure and so have created specific data class.
